The Deli app is a console application that simulates a Deli for the user. When the app runs, the user is taken to the starting screen. From there the user can choose to start a new order, or the user can exit the app. If the user opts to begin a new order, the user then proceeds to the order screen.
From the order screen, the user can opt to order a sandwhich, chips, a drink, or they can proceed to checkout or exit the app. 
From the order sandwhich screen, the user is able to order a 4", 8", or 12" sandwich, select a type of bread, select between premium toppings such as meat and cheese, select regular toppings, and select wether they want the sandwhich toasted or not. After the user completes their sandwhich order, they are returned to the original order screen.

Interesting piece of code: The POSapp automatically gives the customer an 8" sandwhich if they input an invalid input. Similarly if a user inputs an invalid type of bread, the recieve white bread as a default. This is useful because it accounts for human error, and it is an example of how the code mimicks real world behavior.
